My Vertical OEM theme
this theme is technically the starting point for all other themes
this also includes the "close game" icon vertical working correctly

all apps works correctly

home menu almost works, small bug where scrolling system icons sometimes scrolls game icons

lock menu only changes the icon nothing else

the switch standard black & white themes work on this too
